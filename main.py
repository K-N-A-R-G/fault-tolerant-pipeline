    # However, sometimes platforms without a working lchmod() *do* have
    # fchmodat().  (Examples: Linux kernel 3.2 with glibc 2.15,
    # OpenIndiana 3.x.)  And fchmodat() has a flag that theoretically makes
    # it behave like lchmod().  So in theory it would be a suitable
    # replacement for lchmod().  But when lchmod() doesn't work, fchmodat()'s
    # flag doesn't work *either*.  Sadly ./configure isn't sophisticated
    # enough to detect this condition--it only determines whether or not
    # fchmodat() minimally works.
    #
    # Therefore we simply ignore fchmodat() when deciding whether or not
    # os.chmod supports follow_symlinks.  Just checking lchmod() is
